# 🍽️ RecipeViewer

A simple, responsive web app for browsing, filtering, and viewing a collection of easy 3–5 ingredient recipes.

This tool was created to help plan weekly meals using a rotating JSON-based recipe list, with filters like cooking method (Blackstone, Grill, No-cook), health tags (Healthy, Spicy), and estimated prep time. It also supports light/dark mode and mobile responsiveness.
